# JavaScript Calculator Project

## About

The purpose of this app is to provide users with an functional online calculator. The calculator buttons are displayed in a grid format to reflect a traditional calculator and allows users to add, subtract, multiply and divide. The calculator also includes a clear all button for users to start again and make further calculations.

## Functionality

### Add, subtract, multiply & divide

This calculator contains the essential elements of a classic calculator including buttons for digits 0-9 and add, subtract, multiply and divide buttons. These operator buttons are given functionality through an if statement as outlined below:

### Display 

Once the functions of each operatorButton were defined, and the value of each number button was set, this was fed into the calculator display for users to see the numbers they are selecting presented at the top of the screen and ultimately to see the results of their calculations. 

### Equals & Clear all

The final steps to create a fully functioning calculator were the equals button and clear all button. As outlined below, another if statement was used to add functionality to the equals button so that it displayed the answer of any calculation in the display component. The clear button function then enables users to wipe the previous calculation and start again.
